This iterative process leads to intelligent and highly optimized user experiences.</Text>\n         <Text nopad><Highlight>UX Value</Highlight>Data dictates decisions.

RAS switches our brains between passive awareness and active wakefulness. I call the triggers to this system \"Hot-buttons\". For instance if I called you by your first name you would become alert and seek more information about what alerted you and why. </Text>\n          <Text nopad><Highlight>UX Value</Highlight>We can use RAS to get the attention of the user by leveraging visuals, layouts, and graphics as hot-buttons that trigger alertness. </Text>\n          <Minorheading>Hook Engagement</Minorheading>\n          <Text>Imagine being in a busy place like an airport someone says triggers your RAS with your first name as a hot-button. As mentioned above you'd seek information about what and why someone might be calling your attention. But what happens if no one approaches you and you find no further information about it? That's right, You dismiss the alert and continue on your way. This is due to a lack of \"Engagement\". </Text>\n          <Text nopad><Highlight>UX Value</Highlight>We must not settle for simply getting attention.
